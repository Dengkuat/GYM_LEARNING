Spread operator(…), this allows u to spread out elements of an iterated object scuh as an array, map or even set

```html
 const odd = [1,3,5];
const combined = [2,4,6, ...odd];
console.log(combined);
[ 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5 ]const odd = [1,3,5];
[ 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5 ]
```

so in simple terms it unpacks elements of an array, set or even map

**What makes it differ from rest parameter**

so for the rest parameter it must be the last argument of a function however the rest operator can be anywhere u want it to do u the work

There are other split of the spread operator as we will see down below
