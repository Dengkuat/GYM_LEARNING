- **A. Conceptual Questions**
- **Map basics**
    - What is the difference between a Map and a regular JavaScript object for storing key–value pairs?
    
    Map has a key of any type, object, function and primitive datatypes
    
    It aswell has a size property and built in method for iteration
    
    Objects are better for structured data with string keys, while map are better for dynamic order of keys
    
    - Can a Map use functions or objects as keys? Why or why not?
    
    yes, because Map are computed by reference, not by string conversion like object keys
    
    - How does insertion order affect iteration in a Map?
    
    Map preserves the order, iteration over it returns keys in the same order they are added in
    
- **Set basics**
    - What is a Set and how does it handle duplicate values?
    
    set is a collection of unique values, adding another same item wont change anything
    
    - Can a Set store NaN? How does it handle equality checks for NaN?
    
    yes, set can store NaN tho it treats all NaN values as the same 
    
    - How does insertion order affect iteration in a Set?
    
    Set preserves the order in which the elements were inserted
    
- **Performance**
    - In what situations would you choose a Map over an object?
    
    l would use Map in an instance where l am frequently adding and removal of key-value pairs and when keys arent guranted to be strings
    
    - Why might a Set be more efficient than using an array for checking if an item exists?
    
    only one item appears in a set so u dont have to worry if l number will appear twice
