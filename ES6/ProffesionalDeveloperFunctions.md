ES6 Speciation

this is the 6th version of js standard

it brough up major features that modern js developers use daily

this specificatin defines how the language should behave 

this new features include

1- let and const 

2- arrow function

3- template literals

4-default parameters

5- classes

6- modules - imports and exports 

7- promises

8- New data structure like Map and Set, WeakMap and WeakSet

Support Features 

After ES6 was released some browsers no all supported the feauture imediatly

although still some older versions still dont support it

so the browser that supported ES6 immediatly are chrome, safari, firefox, edge 

older ones like internet explorer dont really support the new features that why the ployfills and transpiling come in

Web is Eternal

Once the website is released on the internet, it lives forever 

so the browser supports old code so that site built years ago will still work today

so the old features dont acctually go they just remain backward compatible 

not everybrowser supports new es6 features

so es6 dosnt mean the old features are nolonger usable they are backward compatilbe and still will work the new features are just to enhance coding for developers and make it easier 

Polyfills

This is a piece of code that adds missing ES6 feature to old browser that dont support them

if the browser donsnt understand es6 then the polyfills will teach it 
lets say it dosnt understand or support Array.from()

then we can write a polyfill such as saying Array.from() = how the old browser undertands

so they all are to a mutual agrement

so polyfills help developers use modern es6 to browser that dont undertand es6 without breaking or rewriting everything creating new things 

they can include ployfill.io

When using polyfills

instead of writing them ourself we can just import them or load them from litraries like the polyfills.io

Shim concept

This basically shims a compatibility layer missing in ur codes

Transpliling

This is transforming code from a newer version of js into an older version so all browsers should understand

so this help why not all modern people get get updated and learn the new features

so transpiling ensure your code works everywhere

Using Babel

This is the most popular js transpiler

so this takes ur es6 codes and make them to es5
