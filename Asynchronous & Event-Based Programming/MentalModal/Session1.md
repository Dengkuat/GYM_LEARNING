Asynchronous And Event based programming mental model session

1. Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code execution in JavaScript. How does the JavaScript runtime handle each type of operation?
2. Why do we need asynchronous programming in JavaScript? Give two common examples where it's useful.
3. What are Promise and call back function in simple terms. How using promise is different from using callbacks while handling asynchronous operations?
4. What are the three states of a Promise? Briefly describe each state.
5. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()` in Promise handling?
6. What does the `async` keyword do when placed before a function? What does it mean?
7. Explain what the `await` keyword does in simple terms. Why can't we use it in regular functions?
8. Explain what happens when we use `setTimeout()`. What are its basic parameters?
9. What's the difference between running code with `setTimeout(fn, 0)` versus running it directly?
10. When handling form submissions, why might we want to use async/await?
11. What is a basic error handling pattern when working with Promises?
12. What is the event loop in JavaScript? Describe its relationship with the call stack and callback queue.
13. Describe the difference between microtasks and macrotasks in JavaScript. Provide examples of each.
14. What is the difference between `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`?
