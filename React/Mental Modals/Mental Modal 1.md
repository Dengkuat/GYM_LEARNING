1. **What is React? Is it a framework or a library.**
- React is a JS Library for building user interface by composing reusable components and managing UI state predictably

    1. **What is a single page application(SPA)? How is it different from a multiple page application(MPA)**
     Single Page Application loads a single HTML page once and updates the UI dynamically without fully page reloading
    - MPA(Each navigation is a new HTML from server, Full reloads of pages, slower with a server driven navigation)
    - SPA(Initial load once, JS handles navigation, Faster with app like experience)
    Finally React enables single page application by updating UI without reloading the page
    
    2. How does React compare to other UI libraries like Vue.js or Angular?
    React is a library that is flexible, with a larger ecosystem 
    Vue.js is a framework like, easuer learning curve 
    Angular is a full framework, strict structure, heavy but very powerfull
    
    3. Why is React considered declarative?
    React lets us describe what the UI should look like, not how to update it step by step
